The Spanish Oak Flash Tool is software to read and write the flash memory of a Spanisk Oak 1024k Powertrain Control Module. It has been tested on a PCM from a Ford FG Falcon. The software is free to download, however in order to use the flashing functionality you must purchase an unlock key which can be done from the software. I am actively seeking to teet this software on circa 2005 Ford Crown Victorias and Mustang GTs, if you can assist with this please get in touch.
