The Spanish Oak Flash Tool is software to read and write the flash memory of a Spanisk Oak 1024k Powertrain Control Module. It has been tested on a PCM from a Ford FG Falcon and is compatible with BF, FG, FGII and FGX Ford Falcons. 
I am actively seeking to test this software on circa 2005 Ford Crown Victorias, Mustang GTs Focuses and Fiestas that have the EEC-VI PCM, if you can assist with this please get in touch.
